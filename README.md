# How much taxonomic expertise is necessary for prioritising areas of lowland rainforest sites as habitats for lichens in northeast-Borneo?

Data files (in `data` folder):

1.  Lichen taxonomic data: `lichens_taxa.csv` (from `Tax genus Borneo masterfile PW 26_09_19.xlsx` in `./data/raw/` folder);

2a.  Lichen functional group data: `lichens_func.csv` (from `FunctGroupsData_TreeLevel` sheet in `Copy of Copy of Lichen data tree level_20200825_traits_corr-3.xlsx` in `./data/raw/` folder) -- deleted extra columns, if present (e.g. blank and 'total'), before saving as .csv;

2b.  Lichen functional traits matrix: `lichen_traits.csv` (from `LichenTraitsMatrix` sheet in `Copy of Copy of Lichen data tree level_20200825_traits_corr-3.xlsx` in `./data/raw/` folder );

3a.  Tree functional trait data: `trees_func.csv` (from `Copy of 7_tree data grps +Dipterocarp.xlsx` in `./data/raw/` folder).

3b.  Tree pH data: `trees_pH.csv` (from `Borneo_pH_data.xlsx` in `./data/raw/` folder [equivalent values in `All Tree Data` sheet in `Total tree data_PW_20_6_20.xlsx`]).
