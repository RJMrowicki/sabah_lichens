## Queries

1. In both lichen abundance datasets, there are two _D810_ columns -- is this a mistake (should these be combined into a single column in each case)?

1. The _crsco_ taxfree code is duplicated in the lichen functional group abundance dataset -- should the abundance variables be summed for these two rows?
